## 1. Introduction

Fuse is a compiled, statically typed systems programming language with four
defining properties.

1. Memory safety without a garbage collector.
2. Concurrency safety without a borrow checker.
3. Developer experience as a first-class constraint.
4. Self-hosting as the terminal compiler goal.

Fuse is built in three stages.

- Stage 0 (`fusec0`) was a Python interpreter and is retired.
- Stage 1 (`fusec`) is a Go compiler that emits C11 as a bootstrap backend.
- Stage 2 is the Fuse compiler written in Fuse and compiled by Stage 1.

The implementation stack during bootstrap is fixed.

- Go remains the host implementation language for Stage 1.
- C remains the runtime language during bootstrap.
- Fuse is the implementation language of Stage 2.

The C11 backend is a bootstrap strategy, not the terminal architecture. After
Fuse compiles itself reliably and the native backend is stable, Go and C are
retired from the compiler implementation path. The language semantics are not
defined in terms of Go or C; those are temporary implementation tools.

Fuse v1 is frozen. Features not described in this document do not exist.

### Example

```fuse
import core.result.Result;
import full.chan.Chan;

@value struct WorkItem {
        id: U64,
        payload: String,
}

pub fn process(queue: mutref Chan[WorkItem]) -> Result[(), String] {
        let item = queue.recv()?;
        let upper = item.payload.toUpper();
        spawn fn() {
                log(upper);
        };
        return Ok(());
}
```

The example demonstrates three core properties.

- mutation is visible at the call site through `mutref`
- error propagation is visible through `?`
- concurrency is explicit through `spawn`

## 2. Lexical structure

> Implementation status: SPECIFIED — W01

### 2.1 Tokens

The lexer emits the following token classes.

- identifiers
- keywords
- integer literals
- float literals
- string literals
- raw string literals
- punctuation and delimiters
- operators
- comments and whitespace, which are discarded except where needed for spans

### 2.2 Identifiers

An identifier starts with a Unicode letter or `_`, and continues with Unicode
letters, Unicode digits, or `_`. Identifiers are case-sensitive.

### 2.3 Keywords

The full active keyword set is:

`fn`, `pub`, `struct`, `enum`, `trait`, `impl`, `for`, `in`, `while`, `loop`,
`if`, `else`, `match`, `return`, `let`, `var`, `move`, `ref`, `mutref`,
`owned`, `unsafe`, `spawn`, `chan`, `import`, `as`, `mod`, `use`, `type`,
`const`, `static`, `extern`, `break`, `continue`, `where`, `Self`, `self`,
`true`, `false`, `None`, `Some`.

Additional words may be reserved for future use, but they are not active unless
listed above.

### 2.4 Integer literals

Integer literals may be:

- decimal: `0`, `42`, `9001`
- hexadecimal: `0x2A`
- octal: `0o52`
- binary: `0b101010`

An integer literal may carry a suffix:

`i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, `i128`, `isize`, `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`,
`u128`, `usize`.

Examples:

```fuse
64usize
0xffu8
0b1010i32
```

### 2.5 Float literals

Float literals may contain a decimal point, an exponent, or both. Valid suffixes
are `f32` and `f64`.

Examples:

```fuse
1.0
6.02e23
3.14f32
```

### 2.6 String literals

String literals are UTF-8 and support standard escape sequences.

Supported escapes include:

- `\n`
- `\r`
- `\t`
- `\\`
- `\"`
- Unicode escapes as defined by the compiler implementation

### 2.7 Raw string literals

Raw strings use the Rust-style form:

- `r"..."`
- `r#"..."#`
- `r##"..."##`

The number of `#` characters must match between opener and closer.

### 2.8 Operators and punctuation

Fuse includes the usual arithmetic, logical, assignment, indexing, field access,
and delimiter tokens. The token `?.` is a single longest-match token used for
optional chaining.

### 2.9 Comments

- Line comments begin with `//` and continue to end of line.
- Block comments use `/* ... */` and may nest.

### Implementation contracts

#### Raw string recognition

A raw string is recognized only when the lexer matches the full prefix pattern
`r#*"` and the corresponding closing `"#*` sequence exists. The lexer must not
enter raw-string mode on `r` followed by `#` alone.

`r#abc` must tokenize as:

```text
IDENT("r")
#
IDENT("abc")
```

#### `?.` longest-match rule

The lexer emits `?.` as one token. It is not `?` followed by `.`. The parser
must interpret `expr?.field` as optional chaining, not as postfix `?` applied
to `expr` followed by field access on the result.

#### Literal normalization

Literal text must be normalized at the HIR-to-MIR boundary.

- Integer suffixes are stripped before MIR constant emission.
- String literal payloads are stored without their surrounding quote characters.

The generated C must never contain raw Fuse literal spellings such as
`INT32_C(64usize)` or doubled string quotes such as `""NaN""`.

## 3. Types

> Implementation status: SPECIFIED — W04 (TypeTable), W05 (type checking)

### 3.1 Primitive types

Fuse defines the following primitive numeric and scalar types.

- `Bool`
- `Char`
- `I8`, `I16`, `I32`, `I64`, `I128`, `ISize`
- `U8`, `U16`, `U32`, `U64`, `U128`, `USize`
- `F32`, `F64`

Two aliases are part of the language surface.

- `Int` is the platform word-sized signed integer and is equivalent to `ISize`.
- `Float` is the default floating-point type and is equivalent to `F64`.

### 3.2 Compound types

Fuse supports the following compound types.

- unit: `()`
- tuples: `(T1, T2, ...)`
- arrays: `[T; N]`
- slices: `[T]`
- user-defined structs and enums

### 3.3 Pointer type

`Ptr[T]` is a raw pointer type.

- it is not a borrow
- it does not participate in ownership analysis
- it is permitted only in `unsafe` contexts or runtime bridge code

### 3.4 Generic types

Generic types include standard-library types such as:

- `List[T]`
- `Option[T]`
- `Result[T, E]`

and user-defined generic types.

### 3.5 Type identity

Nominal types are compared by both name and defining symbol. Two types with the
same name from different modules are different types.

Examples:

- `ast.Expr` is not `hir.Expr`
- `resolve.SymbolId` is not `hir.SymbolId`

### 3.6 Primitive method surface

Primitive types expose methods even when those methods are not declared in
ordinary user source.

Required built-in method surface:

- integer types: `toFloat() -> F64`, `toInt() -> I64`, `abs() -> Self`,
  `min(Self) -> Self`, `max(Self) -> Self`
- `F32`, `F64`: `toInt() -> I64`, `isNan() -> Bool`,
  `isInfinite() -> Bool`, `floor() -> Self`, `ceil() -> Self`,
  `sqrt() -> Self`, `abs() -> Self`
- `Char`: `toInt() -> U32`, `isLetter() -> Bool`, `isDigit() -> Bool`,
  `isWhitespace() -> Bool`
- `Bool`: `not() -> Bool`

### 3.7 Numeric operators

Arithmetic operators work on numeric types. Comparison and equality operators
are defined over types that implement the required traits or intrinsic rules.

### 3.8 Tuple field access

Tuple elements are accessed by decimal index.

Examples:

```fuse
let p = (1, 2);
let x = p.0;
let y = p.1;
```

### Implementation contracts

#### Type identity rule

Two nominal types are the same type if and only if they share:

- the same declared name, and
- the same defining symbol or defining module identity

Name-only equality is invalid in a multi-module compiler.

#### Primitive method registration

The checker must register the primitive method surface before any function body
checking begins. Primitive method lookup must not depend on user-declared impls.

#### Numeric widening

Binary operators between two numeric types in the same family are permitted when
the wider type can represent all values of the narrower. For example,
`I32 == ISize` is legal. Bitwise operators require matching signedness and width.

#### Tuple numeric fields

When the receiver is a tuple type, a decimal field name such as `0` or `1` is
an index into the tuple, not a struct field name. This is the only legal tuple
field access form.

## 4. Ownership and lifetimes

> Implementation status: SPECIFIED — W06

Fuse uses explicit ownership annotations and a single liveness computation to
guarantee deterministic destruction without a tracing garbage collector.

### 4.1 Ownership forms

Fuse exposes four ownership forms.

- value ownership: ordinary by-value binding or parameter
- `ref`: shared borrow
- `mutref`: mutable borrow
- `owned`: transferring ownership into a callee or binding

### 4.2 Move semantics

Moves are explicit when needed to escape the normal ownership flow. After a move,
the moved value is no longer usable. Later passes must treat any use after move
as invalid.

### 4.3 Last use and destruction

Destruction is deterministic. The compiler computes liveness once and inserts
drop behavior according to ownership and last-use information.

### 4.4 Escape rules

A borrowed value may not outlive its owner. Escaping borrows are rejected unless
the language construct explicitly transfers ownership or performs an allowed move.

### Implementation contracts

#### Implicit `mutref` on mutable receivers

When a method receiver is declared as `mutref self`, the call site does not need
to spell `mutref` explicitly if the receiver is an existing mutable binding.

Example:

```fuse
var items = List[Int].new();
items.push(1);
```

The call to `push` is valid without `mutref items` because `items` is already a
mutable binding.

#### Borrow lowering rule

`ref x` and `mutref x` must lower to `InstrBorrow` with a precise borrow kind.
They must not lower to a generic unary operator representation. The backend must
be able to distinguish borrow formation from other unary expressions.

#### Drop codegen behavioral contract

An owned local `x` of a type with a `Drop` implementation must, at the point of
its last use on every control flow path, cause the emission of:

```c
TypeName_drop(&_lN);
```

in the generated C. A comment `/* drop _lN */` is not a drop. A wave that claims
deterministic destruction is implemented must include a proof program whose
generated C contains this call, verified by inspection.

## 5. Expressions

> Implementation status: SPECIFIED — W05 (type checking), W07 (lowering)

### 5.1 Basic expressions

Fuse expressions include:

- literals
- identifiers and paths
- tuples
- blocks
- field access
- indexing
- calls
- `if` expressions
- `match` expressions
- loops where the construct yields a value
- closures, if enabled by the language version

### 5.2 Equality and ordering

`==` and `!=` are semantic operations, not merely textual C operators. Equality
uses trait-driven or compiler-defined semantics. Ordering operators require the
appropriate comparison semantics for the operand type.

### 5.3 Optional chaining

Optional chaining uses `?.` and propagates failure or absence according to the
operand type and language rule of the surrounding expression.

### 5.4 Struct literals

Struct literals use the syntax:

```fuse
Point { x: 1.0, y: 2.0 }
```

### 5.5 Enum variant expressions

Enum variants may appear in bare form when unambiguous or in qualified form as
`EnumName.Variant`.

### Implementation contracts

#### Field access versus method-call disambiguation

The surface syntax `obj.name` is ambiguous between a data field read and a
method reference. The lowerer must disambiguate using position.

- If `obj.name` is the direct callee of a call expression, treat it as a method
  reference and emit a method call with `obj` as the first argument.
- Otherwise, treat it as a field access and emit the appropriate field-address
  or field-read logic.

Lowering `self.len()` as a field access is a backend bug.

#### Struct literal disambiguation

`IDENT {` is not automatically a struct literal. It is a struct literal only if
the brace body syntactically looks like a field list, either empty or beginning
with `IDENT :`. Otherwise the identifier remains an expression and the `{` opens
the surrounding block.

#### Qualified enum variant access

The resolver must support `EnumName.Variant` in expression position. Enum
variants are hoisted to module scope, so qualified access is required to make
non-trivial code unambiguous.

#### Generic inference from context

When explicit type arguments are absent, generic arguments are inferred from:

1. value argument types
2. the expected result type from the surrounding expression context

`List.new()` in a field typed `List[Expr]` must infer `Expr` from context.

#### Explicit type arguments on zero-argument generic calls

Calls such as `sizeOf[T]()` and `marker[Int]()` carry type information even when
they have no value arguments. The monomorphizer must receive explicit callee
type arguments directly; a value-argument-only inference path is incomplete.

#### Equality lowering behavioral contract

The lowerer must not emit raw backend equality for every type. For non-scalar
types, equality must lower through the type's equality semantics rather than a
plain C `==` or `!=`. A lowering that emits `==` for a struct type is a bug.

## 6. Statements and control flow

> Implementation status: SPECIFIED — W07 (lowering)

### 6.1 Statements

Fuse statements include:

- `let` bindings
- `var` bindings
- assignments
- item declarations inside blocks where the grammar allows them
- expression statements

### 6.2 Control flow

Fuse supports:

- `if` / `else`
- `while`
- `loop`
- `for ... in`
- `match`
- `return`
- `break`
- `continue`

### 6.3 Diverging expressions

Expressions that never return have type `!` or `Never`. Calls to panic-like or
abort-like functions are diverging expressions.

### Implementation contracts

#### Divergence is structural

After a diverging call, there is no continuing control-flow path. MIR must model
that structurally. The code generator must not synthesize fake temporaries or
fallback values that assume execution continues.

#### Sealed control-flow blocks

Lowering of `return`, `break`, and `continue` must seal the current basic block.
Later control-flow construction must not treat the sealed block as a reachable
fallthrough predecessor.

#### Match behavioral contract

Given a `match` expression with N arms over an enum with discriminants:

- the generated code must evaluate the discriminant tag exactly once
- each arm must be tested in source order
- only the matching arm's body executes
- an arm containing a binding pattern must extract the payload value before
  entering the arm's body

A lowering that unconditionally jumps to the first arm is not a correct
implementation of `match`. A wave that claims match is implemented must include
a proof program with at least three arms that return different values, and the
proof program must fail if match lowering is stubbed.

Example proof program:

```fuse
enum Color { Red, Green, Blue }

fn main() -> I32 {
    let c = Color.Green;
    match c {
        Red   { return 1; }
        Green { return 2; }
        Blue  { return 3; }
    }
}
```

Expected: exits with code 2.
E2E fixture: `tests/e2e/match_enum_dispatch.fuse`

## 7. Functions and methods

> Implementation status: SPECIFIED — W05 (type checking), W07 (lowering)

### 7.1 Function declarations

Functions are declared with `fn` and may be `pub`. Parameters and the return
type are explicit.

Example:

```fuse
pub fn parse(input: ref String) -> Result[Expr, ParseError] {
        ...
}
```

### 7.2 Methods and receivers

Methods appear inside impl blocks. Receivers may be:

- `self`
- `ref self`
- `mutref self`
- `owned self`

Associated functions have no receiver.

### 7.3 Extern declarations

Extern declarations describe FFI entry points and do not have Fuse bodies.

### Implementation contracts

#### Function type registration pre-pass

Every function declaration node, including impl methods and extern declarations,
must receive its function type before any function body is checked.

The checker therefore requires two passes.

- Pass 1: register all function types
- Pass 2: check all function bodies

If impl methods only receive their type during body checking, their metadata
remains `Unknown` during lowering and code generation, which corrupts the
backend pipeline.

#### No function-type gaps after checking

After successful checking, no function declaration in checked HIR may retain an
unknown function type. This is a hard invariant, not a best-effort rule.

## 8. Structs and enums

> Implementation status: SPECIFIED — W05 (type checking), W07 (lowering),
> W17 (generic enum layouts)

### 8.1 Structs

Fuse supports plain structs and value-oriented structs. A value-oriented struct
may opt into auto-derived behavior for the core trait set.

### 8.2 Enums

Enums may contain:

- unit variants
- tuple-like variants
- struct-like variants

### 8.3 Pattern matching

Enum variants are destructured through `match` patterns.

### Implementation contracts

#### Enum variant hoisting

Enum variants are hoisted into the enclosing module namespace. The resolver must
detect conflicts between variants introduced by different enums in the same
module. Qualified access remains valid even when no conflict exists.

#### Unit erasure is total

The unit type `()` has no runtime representation. If it appears in fields,
variant payloads, parameters, arguments, pattern bindings, or function pointer
typedefs, it is erased at every one of those sites. Partial erasure is not
allowed.

#### Enum layout behavioral contract

For a non-generic enum, the generated C struct must contain:

- an integer `_tag` field whose value uniquely identifies each variant
- payload fields for each variant that carries data

For a generic enum `E[T]`, each concrete specialization `E[I32]`, `E[Bool]`,
etc. must produce a distinct C struct with payload fields typed to the concrete
type argument. Unspecialized generic enum definitions must not be emitted.

A wave that claims enum construction and destructuring work must include a proof
program that constructs a variant, matches on it, extracts the payload, and
returns a value that proves the correct arm executed.

## 9. Traits

> Implementation status: SPECIFIED — W05 (trait resolution)

Traits describe behavior. An impl may implement inherent methods, trait methods,
or both.

### 9.1 Trait declarations

Traits may declare methods, associated items, and supertraits.

### 9.2 Trait implementations

A concrete type implements a trait through an impl block that names both the
target type and the implemented trait.

### 9.3 Trait bounds

Generic parameters may be bounded by one or more traits.

### Implementation contracts

#### Bound-chain method lookup

When a receiver is a type parameter with trait bounds, method lookup must search:

1. the directly declared trait bounds
2. the supertraits of those bounds recursively

This is required so that a type parameter bounded by `Hashable` can resolve
methods declared on `Equatable` when `Hashable` extends `Equatable`.

#### Trait parameter ABI casts

When a trait type appears in a parameter position, the backend may need to cast
the concrete pointer type to the trait-representation pointer type at the call
site. Omitting this cast is a backend ABI bug.

## 10. Generics and monomorphization

> Implementation status: SPECIFIED — W17

### 10.1 Generic declarations

Functions, structs, enums, and traits may declare type parameters.

### 10.2 Type inference

Type arguments may be supplied explicitly or inferred from value arguments and
context.

### 10.3 Monomorphization model

The bootstrap compiler emits concrete specializations for generic uses. Generic
functions and generic types are not emitted directly to the bootstrap backend in
unresolved form.

### Implementation contracts

#### Valid specialization requires complete substitution

A specialization is valid if and only if every required type parameter has been
substituted with a concrete type. Required parameters include:

- the generic parameters declared by the function
- the generic parameters declared by its enclosing impl target, if any

Partial specialization must be rejected.

#### Recursive concreteness

A type is concrete only if it contains no unresolved type parameters anywhere in
its structure. Concreteness is recursive.

#### Specialization names include all type arguments

Mangled specialization names must distinguish all concrete type arguments.
`Option[ExprId]` and `Option[StmtId]` must not collide.

#### Only concrete generic instantiations are emitted

The backend emits only concrete instantiations. Unresolved generic types must be
filtered out before type emission.

#### Unresolved types are hard errors before codegen

If any MIR type reaching codegen is unresolved or unknown, the compiler must
emit a diagnostic and abort code generation. Substituting `Unknown` or `int` is
not allowed.

#### Generic compilation behavioral contract

Given `fn identity[T](x: T) -> T { return x; }` and a call `identity[I32](42)`:

- the generated C must contain a function named `Fuse_identity__I32` (or a
  deterministic equivalent) that takes `int32_t` and returns `int32_t`
- `main` must call `Fuse_identity__I32(42)`, not `identity` or any generic form
- calling `identity[Bool](true)` must produce a distinct function `Fuse_identity__Bool`
- the two specializations must not share generated code

A wave that claims generic functions work must include a proof program that calls
the same generic with two different type arguments and verifies both produce the
correct output.

## 11. Modules and imports

> Implementation status: SPECIFIED — W03

### 11.1 Module model

Modules correspond to source files and directory structure according to the
repository layout.

### 11.2 Imports

Imports may refer to modules or to items within modules.

Examples:

```fuse
import core.list.List;
import util.math;
```

### 11.3 Re-exports and selective imports

The module system may re-export symbols and selectively expose imported items
according to the language surface.

### Implementation contracts

#### Module-first import resolution

Resolve an import by first treating the full dotted path as a module path. If no
module exists at that path, retry by treating the final segment as an item name
inside the preceding module path.

#### Stdlib modules are checked like user modules

Stdlib modules must be type-checked in the same pass as user modules. Any pass
that skips stdlib bodies while still lowering or codegening them violates the
frontend-backend contract.

## 12. Concurrency

> Implementation status: SPECIFIED — W13 (hosted stdlib and compiler integration)

Fuse concurrency is explicit and structured.

### 12.1 Channels

`Chan[T]` is the primary message-passing primitive.

### 12.2 Shared state

`Shared[T]` represents shared mutable state protected by synchronization.

### 12.3 Lock ranking

`@rank(N)` is used to define static lock-ordering constraints. Missing ranks on
uses that require them are compile errors.

### 12.4 Threads

`spawn` creates concurrent execution explicitly. Fuse does not use `async` /
`await`.

### Implementation contracts

#### Spawn behavioral contract

`spawn expr` where `expr` is a closure or function value must lower to a runtime
call of the form `fuse_rt_thread_spawn(fn_ptr, env_ptr)`. A lowering that calls
`expr` synchronously is not correct. A wave that claims spawn is implemented must
include a proof program that spawns a thread and observes an effect the spawned
thread produces.

#### Channel type behavioral contract

`Chan[T]` must be represented as a distinct type kind in the type table
(`KindChannel` with element type `T`). Send and receive operations must be
type-checked against the element type. A send of `Bool` to a `Chan[I32]` is a
type error.

## 13. Error handling

> Implementation status: SPECIFIED — W07 (? lowering), W17 (? with generic Result)

Fuse uses explicit result-based error handling.

### 13.1 Sum types

- `Option[T]` represents absence or presence
- `Result[T, E]` represents success or failure

### 13.2 Propagation

`?` propagates errors or absence according to the surrounding context.

### 13.3 No exceptions

Fuse does not define hidden exception flow as part of ordinary control flow.

### Implementation contracts

#### `?` operator behavioral contract

Given a function `f` returning `Result[U, E]` and an expression `expr?` where
`expr: Result[T, E]`:

- if `expr` evaluates to `Ok(v)`, the `?` expression evaluates to `v: T` and
  execution continues normally
- if `expr` evaluates to `Err(e)`, the enclosing function immediately returns
  `Err(e): Result[U, E]` and does not execute subsequent statements

The generated code must contain a branch: a discriminant read on the result's
`_tag` field, a success path that extracts `_f0` as type `T`, and an
early-return path on the error path.

A lowering that returns `Unknown`, passes through `expr` unchanged, or does not
emit a branch is not a correct implementation of `?`. A wave that claims `?` is
implemented must include a proof program that demonstrates both the Ok and Err
paths produce distinct observable outcomes (different exit codes or outputs).

Example proof program:

```fuse
fn maybe_fail(fail: Bool) -> Result[I32, Bool] {
    if fail { return Err(true); }
    return Ok(42);
}

fn run(fail: Bool) -> Result[I32, Bool] {
    let v = maybe_fail(fail)?;
    return Ok(v + 1);
}

fn main() -> I32 {
    match run(false) {
        Ok(v)  { return v; }
        Err(_) { return 0; }
    }
}
```

Expected: exits with code 43.
E2E fixture: `tests/e2e/error_propagation.fuse`

## 14. The unsafe boundary

> Implementation status: SPECIFIED — W09 (backend), W12 (stdlib bridge files)

Unsafe operations are explicit.

### 14.1 Unsafe blocks

Operations that require `unsafe` include:

- dereferencing `Ptr[T]`
- raw pointer arithmetic
- calling FFI functions that cannot be proved safe
- unchecked indexing when the language surface exposes it

### 14.2 Visibility requirement

Unsafe operations must remain visible at their use site. Unsafe behavior must not
be smuggled through apparently safe APIs without explicit language support.

## 15. The C interop ABI

> Implementation status: SPECIFIED — W09

### 15.1 Extern declarations

FFI declarations use `extern` and name the symbol surface exposed to or imported
from the host environment.

### 15.2 Runtime bridge naming

Runtime bridge functions use a stable naming convention rooted in the runtime
surface, typically `fuse_rt_{module}_{operation}`.

### 15.3 Unsafe call-site rule

Every FFI call site is `unsafe` unless the language surface explicitly provides a
safe wrapper.

## 16. Backend representation contracts

> Implementation status: SPECIFIED — W09

This section defines the backend contracts that are not deducible solely from
surface syntax but are required for correct compiler implementation.

### 16.1 Contract 1: The two pointer categories

In the bootstrap C backend there are exactly two categories of pointer-typed
locals.

1. Borrow pointers.
2. `Ptr[T]` values.

Borrow pointers originate from borrow semantics and may need implicit
dereference to recover values. `Ptr[T]` values are first-class pointer values
and must never be implicitly dereferenced.

The backend must track these categories separately.

### 16.2 Contract 2: Unit erasure is total

Once `()` is erased in a concrete ABI position, it is erased at every producer
and consumer site. There is no partially materialized unit value in generated
code.

### 16.3 Contract 3: Monomorphization completeness

Every emitted generic specialization must be complete and concrete. The backend
must not emit calls to unresolved generic symbols.

### 16.4 Contract 4: Divergence is structural

A basic block ending in a diverging call has no successors. Code generation must
not synthesize reads of values that would exist only if control flow continued.

### 16.5 Contract 5: Emission order and aggregate fallback

Composite type definitions must be emitted before they are used by function
signatures or locals in generated C. Aggregate fallback values must be typed
zero-initializers such as `(FuseType_Foo){0}`, not scalar `0`.

### 16.6 Contract 6: Identifier sanitization and collision avoidance

All backend-emitted identifiers must be legal in the target backend language and
must be collision-resistant.

- C keywords must be escaped or renamed deterministically.
- numeric field names used internally must be sanitized
- same-named symbols from different modules must not collide after mangling

## 17. Grammar reference (EBNF)

> Implementation status: SPECIFIED — W02 (parser)

The EBNF below defines the surface grammar at a reference level. Later
implementation documents may refine parser strategy, but they must not change the
language accepted by this grammar without updating this section.
